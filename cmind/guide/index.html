              Moving to Sweden can be intriguing. It’s understandable considering that Sweden probably is the most awesome country in the world!
              Through history of time we’ve brought you rock star innovations and talents, such as; Dynamite (1866), Ingmar Bergman (1918), IKEA (1943), Tetra Pak (1951), Pacemaker (1958), Zlatan Ibrahimović (1981), Erlang (1987), MySQL (1995), Skype (2003), King (2003), Spotify (2006), MariaDB (2009), among other mind blowing things!
              But before you move here, there are some practical matters you should consider, and that we will help you solve. A typical relocation includes everything from helping you find a place to live, organizing your move, administrating all necessities, and finally relocating your talent to Sweden.
              Our local relocation specialists will help you tailor your relocation to fit your specific needs.

            <p>
              <strong>What’s the Swedish culture like?</strong> Sweden is a multi-cultural and ethnically diverse society. What this means for you is that, when you arrive in Sweden you’re immediately part of the crowd and always accepted as the awesome person you are, whoever you are.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>How are Swedish people in general?</strong> Swedish people (“swedes”) are polite and open-minded. You might experience them as shy, but that’s part of being polite, since they don’t want to bother anyone. They will act totally natural if you ask them a question in English.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Can I live in Sweden without speaking Swedish?</strong> Yes, swedes are pretty much fluent in English (thanks to our wide TV selection, where most shows are in English). Also, Sweden is filled with people from all around the world (especially in the bigger cities). So there’s a natural mentality of welcoming foreign people. You will be totally fine with English.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>How can I learn Swedish?</strong> The state offers SFI (Swedish For Immigrants), which is a free language course offered to all people registered in Sweden. So this is a great benefit for you and for family members moving here with you.
